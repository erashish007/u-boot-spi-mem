LS1028ARDB board Overview
-------------------------
Processor
 Two Arm Cortex- A72 processor cores:
  - Based on 64-bit ARMv8 architecture
  - Up to 1.3 GHz operation
  - Single-threaded cores with 48 KB L1 instruction cache and 32 KB L1
    data cache
  - Arranged as a single cluster of two cores sharing a single 1 MB L2
    cache
DDR memory
  - Five onboard 1G x8 discrete memory modules (Four data byte lanes
    ECC)
  - 32-bit data and 4-bit ECC
  - One chip select
  - Data transfer rates of up to 1.6 GT/s
  - Single-bit error correction and double-bit error detection ECC (4-bit
    check word across 32-bit data)
High-speed serial ports(SerDes)
 - Lane 0: Supports one 1 GbE RJ45 SGMII, connected through the
   Qualcomm AR8033 PHY
 - Lane 1: Supports four 1.25 GbE RJ45 QSGMII, each connected
   through the NXP F104S8A PHY
 - Lane 2: Connects to one PCIe M.2 Key-E slot to support PCIe Gen3
   (8 Gbit/s) cards
 - Lane 3: Connects to one PCIe M.2 Key-E slot or one SATA M.2 Key-B
   slot through a register mux to support either PCIe Gen 3 (8 Gbit/s) or
   SATA Gen 3 cards (6 Gbit/s) at a time
eSDHC
 - eSDHC1, eSDHC2
SPI
 - Connects to two mikroBUS sockets to support mikro-click modules,
   such as Bluetooth 4.0, 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 radio transceiver, near
   field communications (NFC) controller
Octal SPI (XSPI)
 - One 256 MB onboard XSPI serial NOR flash memory
 - One 512 MB onboard XSPI serial NAND flash memory
 - Supports a QSPI emulator for offboard QSPI emulation
I2C
 - All system devices are accessed via I2C1, which is multiplexed on
   I2C multiplexer PCA9848 to isolate address conflicts and reduce
   capacitive load
 - I2C1 is used for EEPROMs, RTC, INA220 current-power sensor,
   thermal monitor, PCIe/SATA M.2 connectors and mikro-click modules
   1 and 2
CAN
 - The two CAN DB9 ports can support CAN FD fast phase at data rates of
   up to 5 Mbit/s
Serial audio interface(SAI)
 - Audio codec SGTL5000 provides headphone and audio LINEOUT for
   stereo speakers
 - IEEE1588 interface to support audio on SAI4
